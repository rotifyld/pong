# pong

![](/screenshots/2.png)

Simple game of pong written in Lua using LÃ–VE game engine.

As a side project, I wanted to learn a new language during the weekend. The game allowed me to learn basics of the Lua language and implement OO in it.

One of the other goals was to create a game that requires minimal resources, so aside from a font, every graphical element is generated.

The game currently features:
 - simple engine
 - PvP
 - scoring
 - 5 power ups (growing/shrinking paddles, multiple balls)
 - particle system

Possible future extensions:
 - [ ] enemy AI
 - [ ] drawing power-ups timers
 - [ ] sounds
 - [ ] more power-ups
 - [x] pausing animations
