# pong

simple game of pong written in Lua using LÃ–VE game engine.

as a side project, I wanted to learn some new language during a weekend. the game allowed me to learn basics of the Lua language and implement simple Object Orientation in it.

the game currently features:
 - simple engine
 - PvP
 - scoring
 - 5 power ups (grawing/shrinking paddles, multiple balls)
 - particle system
 
possible future extentions:
 - enemy AI
 - drawing power-ups timers
 - sounds
 - more power-ups
