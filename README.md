# pong

simple game of pong written in Lua using LÃ–VE game engine.

as a side project, I wanted to learn some new language during a weekend. the game allowed me to learn basics of the Lua language and implement simple Object Orientation in it.
also one of the goals was to create a game that requires very few resources, so aside from a font, every graphic element is generated rather than load as a sprite

the game currently features:
 - simple engine
 - PvP
 - scoring
 - 5 power ups (growing/shrinking paddles, multiple balls)
 - particle system

possible future extensions:
 - [ ] enemy AI
 - [ ] drawing power-ups timers
 - [ ] sounds
 - [ ] more power-ups
 - [x] pausing animations
